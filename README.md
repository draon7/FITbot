This is my diploma thesis project

I created a fully 3D printed robotic vehicle using off-the-shelf parts. It is fully 3d printable using FFF/FDM 3D printer with a minimum printing area of 210x210mm. 

The robot uses the following parts:
- Raspberry Pi 3B+
- RPLidar A1M8
- MPU 9250 SPI/IIC module
- motor driver module L9110S
- motor Machifit 25GA370 with encoder
- USB microphone
- servo PDI-1109MG
- USB-C power delivery module ZY12PDN
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2
- Xiaomi MI Power Bank 3
